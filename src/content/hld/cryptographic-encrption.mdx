## **1. Symmetric Encryption**
- **Definition**: Encryption using the same key for both encryption and decryption.

### **Characteristics**
- Faster due to simpler algorithms.
- Secure if the key is kept private.
- Requires secure key sharing between sender and receiver.

### **Use Cases**
- Encrypting data in transit or at rest.
- Securing database records.

---

## **2. Asymmetric Encryption**
- **Definition**: Encryption using a pair of keys (public and private). The public key encrypts data, while the private key decrypts it.

### **Characteristics**
- More secure for communication as no key sharing is required.
- Slower due to complex algorithms.
- Suitable for secure message exchange and digital signatures.

### **Use Cases**
- Secure key exchange.
- Digital certificates and signatures.
