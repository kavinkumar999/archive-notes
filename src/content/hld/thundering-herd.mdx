> 🛠️ Tackling the Thundering Herd Problem in System Design

The **Thundering Herd Problem** can severely affect the performance and reliability of ticket booking systems, particularly during high-demand events like concert ticket sales.

## 🌐 **System Design for Ticket Booking Applications**
Ticket booking applications are designed to handle massive user traffic efficiently by employing the following mechanisms:
1. **Load Balancers**:
   - Distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of services.
   - Prevent a single instance from being overwhelmed by traffic.

2. **Queue and Thread Pool Executors**:
   - Each instance has a queue that buffers incoming requests.
   - A thread pool executor processes requests concurrently but limits the number of simultaneous requests to avoid overloading.

## 🐘 **Thundering Herd Problem**
When a high volume of requests hits the system suddenly, it creates a "thundering herd" effect.

### 📉 Key Impacts:
1. **Queue Saturation**:
   - All queues fill up quickly, denying further requests.
   - Denied requests trigger **retries**, further increasing the load.

2. **Latency Surge**:
   - Under full capacity, systems experience higher latency.
   - Increased latency causes **timeouts**, leading to more retries.

3. **Autoscaling Challenges**:
   - Autoscaling adds new instances to handle increased demand.
   - However, the retry storm often overwhelms the newly scaled system as well.

## 🔁 **Mitigation Strategies**

### 1. **Retry Strategies**
Retries can worsen the problem unless handled carefully. Two effective strategies include:

#### 📈 **Exponential Backoff**:
   - **What it is**: Delays retries progressively based on the number of failures.
   - **Why it works**: Reduces immediate load on the system by spacing out retries.

   > Exponential Backoff -  **baseDelay * 2^retryCount**

#### 🎲 **Jitter**:
   - **What it is**: Adds randomness to exponential backoff intervals.
   - **Why it works**: Prevents retries from synchronizing and creating another surge.



**Example**:
```java
// Pseudo-code for Exponential Backoff with Jitter
int retryCount = 0;
int baseDelay = 100; // 100ms

while (retryCount < MAX_RETRIES) {
    int delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);
    int jitter = random(-50, 50); // Adding randomness
    Thread.sleep(delay + jitter);
    retryCount++;
}
```
