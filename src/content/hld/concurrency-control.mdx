Concurrency arises when multiple transactions or processes attempt to access and modify shared data simultaneously in a distributed system. This can lead to various issues, including:

- **Data Inconsistency**: Data corruption or loss of integrity due to concurrent modifications. 🤯
- **Lost Updates**: Updates from one transaction are overwritten by another, resulting in data loss. 😱
- **Dirty Reads**: Reading data modified by an uncommitted transaction, which may not be valid. 🤔
- **Unrepeatable Reads**: Reading different values of the same data item within a single transaction due to concurrent modifications. 🤷‍♂️

To address these issues, two primary strategies for handling concurrent transactions are employed:

1. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**
2. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**

## **1. Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

This approach involves acquiring locks before data is accessed, preventing other transactions from modifying the data. There are two types of locks:

- **Shared Locks**: Allow multiple transactions to read the data concurrently. 📚
- **Exclusive Locks**: Allow only one transaction to read or write the data at a time. 🛠️

- **Advantages**: Simple to implement and provides strong isolation guarantees. 🏆
- **Disadvantages**: Can lead to high contention and reduced concurrency if locks are held for extended periods. 📉

### **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**
Two-Phase Locking ensures serializability by dividing the transaction execution into two phases:

1. **Growing Phase**: The transaction acquires locks but does not release any. 📈
2. **Shrinking Phase**: The transaction releases locks but does not acquire new ones. 📉

#### **Subtypes of 2PL:**

- **Strict 2PL**: Locks are held until the transaction commits. 🚫
- **Rigorous 2PL**: Locks are held until the transaction commits and its updates are made durable. 🛡️

## **2. Optimistic Concurrency Control**
Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) assumes conflicts are rare and allows transactions to execute without locks, resolving conflicts during a validation phase. 🤞

- **Timestamp Ordering (TO)**: Assigns a timestamp to each transaction and orders operations by these timestamps. 🕒

- **Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Maintains multiple versions of data items to provide consistent reads without locking. 🔄

- **Thomas' Write Rule**: Ignores outdated writes based on timestamps to improve efficiency. 📝

## **Comparison of Concurrency Control Methods**

| **Aspect**            | **Pessimistic (2PL)**      | **Optimistic (OCC)**        |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Locking**            | Extensive                  | No initial locks            |
| **Deadlock Possibility**| Yes                        | No                          |
| **Transaction Blocking**| Frequent                   | Minimal                     |
| **Rollback Frequency** | Low                        | High in conflict scenarios  |
| **Best Use Case**      | High-contention environments | Low-contention environments |
