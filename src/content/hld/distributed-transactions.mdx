title: Distributed Transactions
tag: HLD
---

Distributed transactions enable atomic operations across multiple services or databases in a distributed system. They're essential for maintaining data consistency when a single business operation spans multiple services, such as in microservices architectures.

### **Types of Distributed Transactions**

1. **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) & Three-Phase Commit (3PC)** ⚙️
2. **Saga Pattern** 🎭


### **1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** ⚙️
- **Purpose**: Ensures atomicity in distributed transactions with a coordinator and participants.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Prepare**: Coordinator asks participants to prepare for commit.
  2. **Commit/Abort**: If all agree, commit; otherwise, abort.
- **Pros**: Simple and consistent.
- **Cons**: Blocking, and a single point of failure.

### **1.1. Three-Phase Commit (3PC)** ⚙️
- **Purpose**: Extends 2PC to reduce blocking and uncertainty.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Can Commit**: Coordinator asks if participants can commit.
  2. **Pre-Commit**: Participants prepare to commit.
  3. **Commit/Abort**: Final decision based on responses.
- **Pros**: Non-blocking and fault-tolerant.
- **Cons**: Higher complexity and latency.


### **2. Saga Pattern** 🎭
- **Purpose**: Breaks distributed transactions into smaller, independent steps, each with its own rollback action.
- **Types**:
  1. **Choreography**: Steps trigger each other via events.
  2. **Orchestration**: A central controller manages the steps.
- **Pros**: Highly scalable and flexible.
- **Cons**: Eventual consistency and higher complexity.
- **Example**: E-Commerce system:
  1. Place order → Reserve inventory → Deduct payment.
  2. On failure, trigger compensating actions (e.g., cancel order).

## Design Patterns Comparison Matrix 📊

| Aspect | 2PC 🔒 | 3PC 🔐 | Saga 🎭 |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Communication Type | Synchronous | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| Consistency | Strong | Strong | Eventual |
| Availability | Lower | Medium | High |
| Network Usage | Medium | High | Low |
| Recovery Complexity | Medium | High | Low |
| Implementation Complexity | Medium | High | Medium |
| Scalability | Limited | Limited | High |


### **When to Use**
- **2PC/3PC**: Use for critical, atomic transactions (e.g., financial systems). ⚙️
- **Saga**: Use for scalable, long-running workflows (e.g., e-commerce, ticketing). 🎭
