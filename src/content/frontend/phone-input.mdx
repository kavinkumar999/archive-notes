title: Phone Input

You're given a CSS file for a phone input, and you need to implement the component using React.

The component should return two elements, the input and a submit button.

The input has the following functionality:

- Typing any character except a number has no effect.
- After typing the first number, a "(" is added before that first number. For example, "(1".
- After typing the fourth number, a ") " is added before that new number. For example, "(123) 4". Note there is a space after the closing parenthesis.
- After typing the seventh number, a "-" is added before that new number. For example, "(123) 456-7".
- No more than 10 numbers can be typed, meaning a completed phone number looks like "(123) 456-7890".
- If multiple numbers are typed at once, the same formatting rules apply as if they were typed one at a time.
- Pressing backspace removes one number at a time, including any corresponding formatting characters.
- If the input is empty, it has a placeholder of "(555) 555-5555".

To the left of the input is a button with the text of "Submit" and the following characteristics:

- If the input does not have a complete phone number, the button is disabled.
- Clicking the button when it is enabled clears the input, including any formatting characters.
 
 
 ## Solution

 ```javascript

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const COMPLETE_NUMBER_LENGTH = 14;

export default function PhoneInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const onChange = event => {
    setValue(format(event.target.value));
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="tel"
        value={value}
        onChange={onChange}
        placeholder="(555) 555-5555"
      />
      <button
        disabled={value.length < COMPLETE_NUMBER_LENGTH}
        onClick={() => setValue('')}
      >
        Submit
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

function format(str) {
  const rawString = str.replace(/\D/g, '');
  let output = '';

  if (rawString.length > 0) {
    output += '(';
    output += rawString.substring(0, 3);
  }

  if (rawString.length > 3) {
    output += ') ';
    output += rawString.substring(3, 6);
  }

  if (rawString.length > 6) {
    output += '-';
    output += rawString.substring(6, 10);
  }
  return output;
}
```
