### 1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

**Definition:**  
Each piece of code should appear only once in the entire system. Duplicating code across multiple locations makes maintenance harder and increases inconsistencies.

**Solution:**  
Modularize your source code by writing each task as a separate method, promoting code reuse.

**Example of Poor Coding:**

```java
public class AreaCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Area of rectangle
        double length = 5.0;
        double width = 3.0;
        double rectangleArea = length * width;
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle: " + rectangleArea);

        // Area of circle
        double radius = 4.0;
        double circleArea = Math.PI * radius * radius;
        System.out.println("Area of circle: " + circleArea);
    }
}
```

**Violation:** Code duplication in area calculation.

**Example of Best Coding Practice:**

```java
public class AreaCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double length = 5.0;
        double width = 3.0;
        double rectangleArea = calculateRectangleArea(length, width);
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle: " + rectangleArea);

        double radius = 4.0;
        double circleArea = calculateCircleArea(radius);
        System.out.println("Area of circle: " + circleArea);
    }

    private static double calculateRectangleArea(double length, double width) {
        return length * width;
    }

    private static double calculateCircleArea(double radius) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

### 2. KISS - Keep It Simple and Stupid

**Definition:**  
Code should be simple, easy to understand, and straightforward to debug and modify. This reduces complexity and minimizes bugs.

**Example of Poor Coding:**

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Complex logic for simple factorial calculation.
    }
}
```

**Example of Best Coding Practice:**

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
        } else {
            long factorial = calculateFactorial(number);
            System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is " + factorial);
        }
    }

    private static long calculateFactorial(int n) {
        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### 3. YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It

**Definition:**  
Implement features only when they are needed. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.

**Example of Poor Coding:** Includes unnecessary discount handling in a shopping cart class.

**Example of Best Coding Practice:** Focus only on essential functionality for the current requirements.

---

### 4. SoC - Separation of Concerns

**Definition:**  
Organize code into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern. This promotes modularity and scalability.

**Example of Poor Coding:**  
Combines user input, validation, and display logic in a single class.

**Example of Best Coding Practice:**  
Separate these concerns into different classes.

---

### 5. Favor Composition over Inheritance

**Definition:**  
Prefer composing objects rather than relying on inheritance. This supports "has a" relationships and enhances flexibility.

**Example of Poor Coding:**

```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting");
    }
}
```

**Example of Best Coding Practice:** Use composition to include functionality in classes like `Engine`, `Horn`, and `Bell`.

---

### 6. Program to Interface, not Implementation

**Definition:**  
Use interfaces to decouple code from specific implementations, enhancing flexibility.

**Example of Poor Coding:**  
Directly uses concrete classes, leading to tighter coupling.

**Example of Best Coding Practice:**  

```java
interface Drivable {
    void drive();
}
```

---

**Key Takeaway:** Applying these principles results in cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.
