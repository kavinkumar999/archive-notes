## Atomicity
**Atomicity** in the context of a database transaction refers to the property that ensures that either all the operations of a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. It's like an all-or-nothing principle. Here's a simple breakdown of atomicity:

1. **All or Nothing:**
   - Atomicity guarantees that if any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and no changes are applied to the database.

2. **Example: Money Transfer**
   - Imagine you're transferring money from one bank account to another. The transaction involves two operations: deducting money from one account and adding it to another.

  ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;

   UPDATE sender_account SET balance = balance - transfer_amount WHERE account_id = sender_id;
   UPDATE receiver_account SET balance = balance + transfer_amount WHERE account_id = receiver_id;

   COMMIT;
  ```

## Consistency

- **Consistency** in the context of a database transaction refers to the property that ensures a transaction brings the database **from one consistent state to another**. 
- It enforces integrity constraints and rules defined in the database schema. Here's a simple breakdown of consistency:

1. **Enforcement of Rules:**
   - Consistency ensures that a transaction transforms the database from a valid state to another valid state, adhering to predefined integrity constraints.

2. **Example: Transfer Constraints**
   - Consider a banking application where money transfers must satisfy constraints like ensuring the sender has sufficient funds.

    ```sql
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    IF sender_balance >= transfer_amount THEN
        UPDATE sender_account SET balance = balance - transfer_amount WHERE account_id = sender_id;
        UPDATE receiver_account SET balance = balance + transfer_amount WHERE account_id = receiver_id;
        COMMIT;
    ELSE
        ROLLBACK;
    END IF;
    ```
## Durability

**Durability** in the context of a database transaction refers to the property that ensures once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive any subsequent failures, such as system crashes

## Isolation

 - When Multiple Transaction are executed parallelly, **Isolation** determines who much the changes of one transaction is visible to other transaction.

![example](/png/database/isolation-example.png)

  - Isolation levels dictate how much a transaction's changes are visible to other transactions running concurrently


### Isolation Levels

#### Repeatable Read
- **Consistent reads** withing the same transaction
- if the other transaction committed, the changes are not visible to the current transaction(it repeatedly read the same data)
- So Maintain the same snapshot through the transaction

#### Read Committed
- **Read the latest committed data**
- Reads within the same transaction always reads the fresh value
- So Multiple reads within the same transaction may return different values(**inconsistent reads**)

#### Read Uncommitted
- **Read the uncommitted data**
- Reads within the same transaction may read the uncommitted data (**dirty reads**)
- So Multiple reads within the same transaction may return different values(**inconsistent reads**)

#### Serializable (**Highest Isolation Level**)
- **Read the data as if the transaction is executed serially**
- Every read is Locking ready
- So, if the on transaction is reading the data, other transactions have to **wait until the first transaction is completed**
