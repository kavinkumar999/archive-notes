In a database, a **key** is an attribute or a set of attributes that helps identify a record in a table. 

## 1. Primary Key

### Definition:
A **Primary Key** is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies each record in a table. The values in the primary key columns must be unique and cannot be null.

- **Conditions**:
  - Each value in the primary key must be unique.
  - Cannot have `NULL` values.
  - Each table can have only one primary key.

### Example:

| Student_ID (PK) | Name    | Age |
|-----------------|---------|-----|
| 1               | Alice   | 20  |
| 2               | Bob     | 22  |
| 3               | Charlie | 21  |

In the above table, `Student_ID` is the **Primary Key**.

---

## 2. Candidate Key

### Definition:
A **Candidate Key** is a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table. There can be multiple candidate keys in a table, and each can be used as a primary key.

- **Conditions**:
  - A candidate key must uniquely identify each row.
  - It must be minimal (i.e., no subset of the candidate key can uniquely identify the record).

### Example:

| Employee_ID (CK) | Name    | Phone_Number (CK) |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1                | Alice   | 12345             |
| 2                | Bob     | 67890             |
| 3                | Charlie | 11223             |

Here, both `Employee_ID` and `Phone_Number` are **Candidate Keys** since either can uniquely identify a record. One of them will be selected as the **Primary Key**.

---

## 3. Alternate Key

### Definition:
An **Alternate Key** is any candidate key that is not selected as the primary key. It is still capable of uniquely identifying records but is not chosen for use as the primary key.

- **Conditions**:
  - It is a candidate key, but not the primary key.

### Example:

Continuing from the previous example, if we select `Employee_ID` as the primary key, then `Phone_Number` becomes an **Alternate Key**.

| Employee_ID (PK) | Name    | Phone_Number (AK) |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1                | Alice   | 12345             |
| 2                | Bob     | 67890             |
| 3                | Charlie | 11223             |

In this case, `Phone_Number` is an **Alternate Key**.

---

## 4. Foreign Key

### Definition:
A **Foreign Key** is an attribute or a set of attributes in a table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. It is a reference to the primary key in another table.

- **Conditions**:
  - The values in the foreign key column must match the primary key values in the referenced table or be null.
  - A foreign key creates a relationship between two tables.

### Example:

**Student Table:**

| Student_ID (PK) | Name    | Age |
|-----------------|---------|-----|
| 1               | Alice   | 20  |
| 2               | Bob     | 22  |

**Course Table:**

| Course_ID (PK) | Course_Name | Student_ID (FK) |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 101            | Math        | 1               |
| 102            | Science     | 2               |

Here, `Student_ID` in the **Course Table** is a **Foreign Key** referencing the `Student_ID` in the **Student Table**.

---

## 5. Superkey

### Definition:
A **Super key** is a set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table. A super key may contain extra attributes that are not necessary to uniquely identify the record.

- **Conditions**:
  - A superkey can have additional attributes beyond those required for uniqueness.
  - Every **Primary Key** is a superkey, but not every superkey is a primary key.

### Example:

| Student_ID (SK) | Name    | Age |
|-----------------|---------|-----|
| 1               | Alice   | 20  |
| 2               | Bob     | 22  |

Here, the combination of `Student_ID` and `Age` is a **Superkey** because `Student_ID` alone is enough to uniquely identify each record, but adding `Age` does not change the fact that the superkey still uniquely identifies records.

---

## 6. Composite Key

### Definition:
A **Composite Key** is a primary key that consists of more than one attribute. It is used when no single attribute can uniquely identify a record.

- **Conditions**:
  - It must contain more than one attribute.
  - The combination of the attributes must uniquely identify each record.

### Example:

| Student_ID (PK) | Course_ID (PK) | Course_Name  |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1               | 101            | Math         |
| 1               | 102            | Science      |
| 2               | 101            | Math         |

Here, the combination of `Student_ID` and `Course_ID` forms a **Composite Key** to uniquely identify each record.

---

## 7. Unique Key

### Definition:
A **Unique Key** is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a record, similar to a primary key. However, unlike the primary key, it can accept `NULL` values.

- **Conditions**:
  - Unique keys ensure uniqueness of data but can allow `NULL` values.
  - A table can have multiple unique keys.

### Example:

| Employee_ID (PK) | Email (UK)        | Name    |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1                | alice@email.com    | Alice   |
| 2                | bob@email.com      | Bob     |
| 3                | charlie@email.com  | Charlie |

Here, `Email` is a **Unique Key** since it must be unique, but can also accept `NULL` values if necessary.

---

## 8. Candidate Key vs Superkey

- **Candidate Key**: A minimal key that uniquely identifies records in a table. No redundant attributes are included.
- **Supe rkey**: A set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify records, but it may contain redundant attributes.

**Key Difference**:
- A **Superkey** can contain additional attributes beyond those required for uniqueness, while a **Candidate Key** is minimal.
- Every **Candidate Key** is a **Superkey**, but not every **Superkey** is a **Candidate Key**.

### Example:
Consider a table where `Student_ID`, `Phone_Number`, and their combinations form superkeys.

| Student_ID (CK) | Phone_Number (CK) | Name    |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1               | 12345             | Alice   |
| 2               | 67890             | Bob     |
| 3               | 11223             | Charlie |

Here, both `Student_ID` and `Phone_Number` are **Candidate Keys**, and `{Student_ID, Phone_Number}` is a **Superkey** (but not minimal).

## TLDR:

| Key Type        | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Key** | Uniquely identifies each record, cannot be NULL |
| **Candidate Key** | Minimal set of attributes that uniquely identify records |
| **Alternate Key** | A candidate key not chosen as the primary key |
| **Foreign Key** | Refers to the primary key in another table, creates relationships |
| **Superkey**    | A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record, may contain redundant attributes |
| **Composite Key** | Primary key made up of more than one attribute |
| **Unique Key**  | Ensures uniqueness, can accept NULL values |
| **Candidate Key vs Superkey** | Candidate Key is minimal, Superkey may contain extra attributes |
