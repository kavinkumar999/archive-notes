## Stripe Implements Idempotent APIs 🚀💳

Stripe, founded in 2010 by two brothers in California, revolutionized online payments by solving a fundamental problem: **double payments**. This issue arises when users are mistakenly charged twice for the same transaction. Let’s dive into how Stripe tackled this challenge using **idempotent APIs**. 

### **The Double Payment Problem** ⚠️  
Double payments can occur due to two major reasons:

#### 1. **Server Errors** 🖥️
- The request might fail while the server is processing it.  
- The client doesn’t know if the request succeeded, making retries unsafe.  
- Retrying without safeguards may result in duplicate charges.

#### 2. **Network Errors** 🌐  
- The server successfully processes the request, but the network fails while returning the response to the client.  
- The client remains unsure whether the request succeeded, leading to potential retries and double payments.

### **The Solution: [Idempotent](/note/idempotency-design) APIs** 🛡️  
An **idempotent API** ensures that a specific request can be retried multiple times without unintended side effects. Essentially, a particular request is guaranteed to be processed **exactly once**, even after multiple retries.

Here’s how Stripe achieves this using the [Idempotency](/note/idempotency-design) key:  

### **1. Idempotency Keys** 🔑
- **What is an idempotency key?**  
  A **unique string (UUID)** that acts as a fingerprint for each request.  
  - It helps track whether a request has already been processed.
  - A new UUID is generated whenever the request payload changes.

- **How is it used?**  
  - The client sends the idempotency key in the **HTTP headers** with every request.  
  - On the server side:
    - Stripe stores the idempotency keys in an **in-memory database**.
    - After processing a request, it caches the server response.
    - If a duplicate request arrives, the cached response is returned instead of reprocessing it.

- **What happens during errors?**  
  - If a **server error** occurs, Stripe rolls back the transaction using an **ACID-compliant database** to maintain consistency.  
  - Idempotency keys are **removed after 24 hours**, allowing for retries while minimizing storage costs.


### **2. Retrying Failed Requests** 🔄  
Retrying failed requests is a crucial feature but can overload servers if not handled carefully.

- **Exponential Backoff** ⏳  
  Clients wait progressively longer between retries to avoid overwhelming the server.

- **Jitter** 🎲  
  Random delays (jitter) are added to the waiting time to prevent the **thundering herd problem**, where many clients retry at once and cause server overload.

### **Curious Facts About Stripe's Idempotency** 🌟  
- Idempotency keys are like digital fingerprints for transactions—unique, trackable, and reusable after 24 hours.  
- The combination of **exponential backoff** and **jitter** ensures robust retry mechanisms without compromising server health.  
- Stripe's system design reflects the philosophy that **simple solutions are often the best solutions**.
