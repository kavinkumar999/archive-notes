title: Idempotency Design for POST API
tags: HLD
---

## **1. What is Idempotency?**
- **Definition:** An operation is idempotent if performing it multiple times results in the same outcome as performing it once.
- **Key Requirement:** The system remains in the same state regardless of how many times the request is made.


## **2. Importance of Idempotency**
- **Prevents Duplicate Operations:** Ensures actions like resource creation or payment processing are executed only once.
- **Resilience to Network Issues:** Handles retries gracefully during server timeouts or disconnections.
- **Consistency:** Improves the reliability of distributed systems by avoiding unintended state changes.


## **3. Idempotency in HTTP Methods**

| **HTTP Method** | **Idempotent?** | **Description**                      |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **GET**         | Yes             | Fetches resource without modifying it. |
| **PUT**         | Yes             | Updates or creates a resource; repeated calls yield the same result. |
| **DELETE**      | Yes             | Deletes a resource; subsequent calls have no additional effect. |
| **POST**        | No (by default) | Creates or triggers actions; needs special handling for idempotency. |


## **4. Achieving Idempotency for POST APIs**

### **1. Use Unique Request Identifiers (Idempotency Keys)**
- **Client:** Generates a unique `Idempotency-Key` for each request.
- **Server:**  
  - Checks for the key in a persistent store.
  - If the key exists, returns the previous response without processing again.
  - If the key doesn't exist, processes the request and stores the key.

#### **Example Workflow**
```json
POST /create-payment
Headers:
{
  "Idempotency-Key": "abcd-1234-unique-key"
}
Body:
{
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "payment_method": "credit_card"
}
```

1. **First Request:**  
   - Payment created, response stored with key `"abcd-1234-unique-key"`.
2. **Duplicate Request:**  
   - Server returns the same response without creating a new payment.


### **2. Atomic Operations**
- Ensure that the **payment creation and key storage** occur in a single database transaction.
- Prevents partial operations that could lead to system inconsistency.


### **3. Request Status Tracking**
- Implement a **status check API** that allows clients to query the status of a transaction.

#### **Status Check API Example**
```http
GET /payment-status?idempotency_key=abcd-1234-unique-key
```

#### **Sample Response**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "transaction_id": "txn-7890",
  "amount": 100.00
}
```


### **4. Database Constraints**
- Use **unique constraints** on transaction-related fields (e.g., `order_id` or `transaction_id`) to prevent duplicate records.

#### **SQL Example**
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_transaction_id ON payments (idempotency_key);
```


## **5. Example Scenario: Payment Processing**

### **Problem:**  
Network timeout during payment creation causes client retries, potentially resulting in duplicate charges.

### **Solution:**  
- Client sends a unique `Idempotency-Key` with each payment request.
- Server stores the key and payment result atomically.
- On retries, server checks for the key and returns the same response.


## **6. Best Practices for Idempotency**

| **Technique**         | **Description**                                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Idempotency Keys**   | Detect and prevent duplicate operations using unique keys. |
| **Atomic Operations**  | Ensure request processing and storage are done together.  |
| **Status Check API**   | Allow clients to verify transaction completion.           |
| **Database Constraints** | Enforce uniqueness to avoid duplicate entries.          |



## **TLDR ðŸ“Œ:**
- **Idempotency is critical** for ensuring reliable operations in distributed systems and critical processes like payment transactions.
- Techniques like **idempotency keys**, **atomic operations**, and **status tracking** help prevent duplicate actions and maintain consistency.
- Careful design of APIs ensures robust and user-friendly systems even in error-prone environments.
