## What is CAP Theorem?

CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of these guarantees:

- **C**onsistency
- **A**vailability 
- **P**artition Tolerance

## Understanding the Three Components

### 1. Consistency (C)
- Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- All nodes see the same data at the same time
- If data is updated in one node, it should be instantly updated in all nodes

### 2. Availability (A)
- Every request receives a response (non-error)
- System remains operational and responsive
- No guarantee that the response contains the most recent data

### 3. Partition Tolerance (P)
- System continues to operate despite network failures
- System functions even when network partitions occur
- Handles communication breakdowns between nodes

## Important Distinctions

### Consistency in Different Contexts
- **ACID Consistency**: Refers to data moving from one valid state to another
- **CAP Consistency**: Refers to all nodes having the same data at the same time

## Possible Combinations

In distributed systems, you can only choose two out of three properties:

1. **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**
   - Sacrifices availability
   - Good for: Banking, payments, stock trading
   - When consistency is crucial

2. **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**
   - Sacrifices consistency
   - Good for: Social media, content delivery
   - When eventual consistency is acceptable

3. **CA (Consistency + Availability)**
   - Sacrifices partition tolerance
   - Not practical in distributed systems
   - Network partitions are inevitable

## Real-World Example

Consider a system with three nodes (A, B, C):

### Scenario 1: Consistency
- All nodes (A, B, C) maintain the same data
- When B updates data, it must propagate to A and C
- System ensures all nodes show same data or returns error

### Scenario 2: Availability
- If node B fails, A and C continue operating
- System keeps responding to requests
- May not have most recent data

### Scenario 3: Partition Tolerance
- Network partition separates B from A and C
- System continues functioning despite partition
- May sacrifice either consistency or availability

## Making the Choice

### Why not CA?
- CA systems assume no network partitions
- In real distributed systems, network partitions are inevitable
- Therefore, must choose between CP or AP

### Choosing Between CP and AP

Choose CP (Consistency over Availability) when:
- Dealing with financial transactions
- Managing critical business data
- Working with systems requiring strong consistency

Choose AP (Availability over Consistency) when:
- Building social media platforms
- Managing content delivery systems
- Handling non-critical data where eventual consistency is acceptable
