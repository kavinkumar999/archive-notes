System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements.

> System design requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems

## Availability

Availability refers to the odds of a particular server or service being up and running at any point in time, usually measured in percentages

### High Availability (HA)
Used to describe systems that have particularly high levels of availability, typically 5 nines or more; sometimes abbreviated as "HA."

### Uptime Percentages
Availability typically refers to percentages of uptime. For example, 5 nines of availability means an uptime of 99.999% of the time. Below are the downtimes expected per year depending on those 9s:

- 99% (two 9s): 87.7 hours
- 99.9% (three 9s): 8.8 hours
- 99.99%: 52.6 minutes
- 99.999%: 5.3 minutes


## Client-Server Model

### Client
A **client** is a machine or process that requests data or services from a server.

### Server
A **server** is a machine or process that provides data or services for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.


## Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses
An address given to each machine connected to the public internet.

### IPv4 Addresses
IPv4 addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots: `a.b.c.d` where all four numbers are between 0 and 255.


#### Special IPv4 Values
- `127.0.0.1`: Your own local machine, also known as **localhost**.
- `192.168.x.y`: Your private network, such as your machine and all machines on your private Wi-Fi network, usually having the `192.168` prefix.

## Port
In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding, they use a **port**, which is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>).

### Port Types
- Ports 0-1023 are reserved for **system ports** (also known as **well-known ports**) and are not typically used by user-level processes.

#### Common Port Uses
- 22: Secure Shell (SSH)
- 53: DNS lookup
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS

## Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses.


## Network Protocols
**IP**
  - Stands for **Internet Protocol**. This network protocol outlines how almost all machine-to-machine communications should happen in the world. Other protocols like **TCP**, **UDP**, and **HTTP** are built on top of IP.

**TCP**
  - Network protocol built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP). Allows for ordered, reliable data delivery between machines over the public internet by creating a **connection**.
  - TCP is usually implemented in the kernel, which exposes **sockets** to applications that they can use to stream data through an open connection.

**HTTP**
  - The **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol is a very common network protocol implemented on top of TCP. Clients make HTTP requests, and servers respond with a response.


## Proxy

### Forward Proxy

- **Description**: A server that sits between a client and servers, acting on behalf of the client. Often used to mask the client's identity (IP address). Commonly referred to as just proxies.

- **Uses Case**: Useful for content filtering, enforcing company policies, and protecting internal networks from external threats.

- **Example**: VPNs, Tor, and web proxies.

### Reverse Proxy

- **Description**: A server that sits between clients and servers, acting on behalf of the servers. Typically used for logging, load balancing, or caching.

- **Uses Case**: Ideal for load balancing, caching content for faster access, and concealing the characteristics and location of the backend servers for enhanced security.

- **Example**: Nginx, HAProxy, and AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

## Load Balancer
  A type of **reverse proxy** that distributes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be used to distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.

### Load Balancer Selection Statergies
- **Round Robin**: Distributes traffic evenly across servers.
- **Least Connections**: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash**: Distributes traffic based on the IP address of the client.

## Latency and Throughput
- **Latency** is the time delay between initiating a task and its completion.
- **Throughput** is the number of tasks completed per unit of time.

> Good System == Low latency and High Throughput

## Caching
Caching is the process of storing data in a temporary storage area to reduce the time it takes to access that data.

### Cache Hit
When a request is made for data that is already stored in the cache.

### Cache Miss
When a request is made for data that is not stored in the cache.

### Cache Eviction
When the cache is full and a new piece of data needs to be stored, the cache must decide which piece of data to remove to make room for the new data.
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Removes the least recently used data.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: Removes the least frequently used data.

### CDN
A CDN is a third-party service that acts like a cache for your servers. It stores copies of your data in multiple locations around the world to reduce latency and improve performance.
