## What is Consistent Hashing?

Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems, such as load balancing, caching, and databases, to **distribute data across a cluster of servers** efficiently. 

- It minimizes data movement when the system's configuration (number of servers) changes.
- Particularly useful when servers are frequently added or removed.

## Why Do We Need Consistent Hashing?

- **Problem**: Traditional hashing techniques cause a large portion of the data to be rehashed and relocated whenever a server is added or removed, which is inefficient.
- **Solution**: Consistent hashing ensures that only a small number of data items (keys) need to be reassigned when a server is added or removed.

## How Does Consistent Hashing Work?

1. **Hash the Nodes (Servers)**: Servers are assigned a hash value and mapped onto a **circular hash ring**.
2. **Hash the Data (Keys)**: Data items (or keys) are also hashed to a point on the ring.
3. **Assign Keys to Servers**: Each key is assigned to the **next server** in a clockwise direction.
4. When a server is added or removed, **only a few keys** are affected, minimizing data movement.

## Example: Consistent Hashing in Action

Let’s walk through a simple example with 4 servers and 3 keys.

### Step 1: Hash the Servers

We have 4 servers, and we assign each one a hash value:

- **Server A** → Hash: 10
- **Server B** → Hash: 30
- **Server C** → Hash: 50
- **Server D** → Hash: 70

These hash values are placed on the circular ring.

### Step 2: Hash the Keys

We now have 3 keys to hash and assign to the servers:

- **Key 1** → Hash: 20
- **Key 2** → Hash: 40
- **Key 3** → Hash: 60

These hash values are also placed on the ring.

### Step 3: Assign Keys to Servers

Each key is assigned to the **next closest server** in a clockwise direction:

- **Key 1 (Hash: 20)** → **Server B** (since 20 is closest to 30)
- **Key 2 (Hash: 40)** → **Server C** (since 40 is closest to 50)
- **Key 3 (Hash: 60)** → **Server D** (since 60 is closest to 70)

### Step 4: Visualizing the Ring

The system now looks like this:
```mdx
          +--------------------------+
          |                          |
          |    Server A (Hash: 10)    |
          |                          |
          +--------------------------+
                     |
                     | Key 1 (Hash: 20)
                     v
          +--------------------------+
          |                          |
          |    Server B (Hash: 30)    |
          |                          |
          +--------------------------+
                     |
                     | Key 2 (Hash: 40)
                     v
          +--------------------------+
          |                          |
          |    Server C (Hash: 50)    |
          |                          |
          +--------------------------+
                     |
                     | Key 3 (Hash: 60)
                     v
          +--------------------------+
          |                          |
          |    Server D (Hash: 70)    |
          |                          |
          +--------------------------+
                     |
                     | (wraps around)
                     v
          +--------------------------+
          |                          |
          |    Server A (Hash: 10)    |
          |                          |
          +--------------------------+

```

## Step 5: Adding or Removing Servers

### 1. **Adding a New Server**:

If we add a new server (say **Server E**) with hash 25, it will be placed between **Server A (10)** and **Server B (30)**.

- **Key 1** (previously assigned to Server B) will now be moved to **Server E** since 25 is closer to 25 than 30.

### 2. **Removing a Server**:

If we remove **Server C**, then **Key 2** (which was assigned to Server C) will be reassigned to the next closest server, which is **Server D**.

## Benefits of Consistent Hashing

1. **Minimal Movement of Data**: When a server is added or removed, only a small number of keys are affected.
2. **Scalable**: The system can scale easily by adding new servers without significant reshuffling of data.
3. **Efficient**: Data movement is minimized, improving the system's performance and reducing overhead.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Distributed Caching Systems**: In systems like **Memcached** or **Redis**, consistent hashing helps distribute data evenly across cache servers, minimizing reconfiguration when nodes are added.
2. **Distributed Databases**: Systems like **Cassandra** or **Amazon DynamoDB** use consistent hashing to efficiently partition data across nodes.
3. **Load Balancing**: Some load balancers use consistent hashing to route traffic to different servers based on the hash of the incoming request.

**Note**: The hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) used for mapping servers and data to the ring can vary based on the system's needs.
